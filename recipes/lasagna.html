        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Lasagna is a culinary dish made with stacked 
                layers of pasta alternated with sauces and 
                ingredients such as meats, vegetables and cheese, 
                and sometimes topped with melted grated mozzarella 
                cheese. It is made with a type of wide, flat pasta, 
                possibly one of the oldest types of pasta.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375ยบ. 
                In a large pot of salted boiling water, 
                cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. 
                Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. 
                Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. 
                Remove from heat and drain fat. 
                Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. 
                Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg 
                in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce 
                across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, 
                a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. 
                Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, 
                Parmesan, and mozzarella.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature 
                to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
