        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                For this recipe, there is no rising involved!  
                This is a 30 minute dough, that requires a higher 
                amount of yeast, and eliminates the rising process 
                altogether.  You can allow the dough to rest, in a 
                large bowl for 30 minutes if you prefer though.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dough is able to be frozen for up to three months. 
                Wrap your ball of dough in plastic wrap and place into a 
                freezer safe bag, and seal, squeezing out all of the air. 
                Thaw dough in the refrigerator overnight (8-10 hours) before 
            using.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Yeast</li>
            <li>1 Cup Warm Water</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 - 3 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, or bowl of stand mixer, stir the yeast and sugar into the warm water until completely dissolved. Allow mixture to sit and proof for 10 minutes, until foamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the salt and olive oil to the yeast mixture.  Begin adding the flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring (with a large spoon or hook attachment if using stand mixer) after each addition.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the dough has pulled away from the sides of the bowl and is no longer sticky, knead the dough for 3 minutes in the bowl or on a well floured surface. You can also knead with the dough hook attachment on medium speed for 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll or pat the dough out on a well floured surface, into a large circle about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick, and place on oiled pizza pan.
            </li>
        </ol>
