        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Margherita pizza history has it that this Neapolitan 
                pie was created in 1889, when Italian chef Raffaele 
                Esposito visited Queen Margherita of Savoy in Naples 
                and was tasked with making her a special dish. 
                Esposito and his wife whipped up a pizza using basil, 
                mozzarella and tomato sauce to resemble the Italian flag. 
                They appropriately dubbed it the “Margherita Pizza” after 
                the Queen herself.
